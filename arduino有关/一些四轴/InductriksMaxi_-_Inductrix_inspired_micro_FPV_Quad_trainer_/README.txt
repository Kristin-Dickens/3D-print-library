# Summary

This is a micro quad (113mm diagonal) inspired by Blade Inductrix model. Perfect for beginners, it can take quite a hit before the damage will be unrecoverable. Small cracks can be cured with a drop of acetone (ABS) or CA... with a 2:1 power-ratio it can be quite fast and agile. I did it to learn the Rate mode FPV flying, since learning with a heavier quad can be dangerous and expensive :). And it is easy to carry it with you all the time.

Parts used:
- Blade NanoQX FPV board (mounted below the frame, with stock foam adhesive placed on the top of the board, two drops of hot glue do it too, the FPV version has stronger FETs which is necessary to handle the bigger  motors)
- 8.5mm Motors from micro-motor-warehouse.com
- Turnigy 1S 600mAh
- Hubsan X4 Props
- Quanum FPV cam

All up weight came up to be 71g. Frame alone is 21g. Flying times are anywhere between 5-7 minutes, depending on your style.
UPDATE#1:
I have increased the thickness of motor pods beams, since these have proved to be the weakest spot in the design. No measurable increase in weight :).
Successfully crashed the frame several times with absolutely no damage.
 

# Print Settings

Other that that it is an easy print...

# How I Designed This

I have been flying the Blade Inductrix for quite some time now... I really like the concept of not hitting things with quad propellers, especially during the learning curve :).
Blade Inductrix is fine for indoors and calm outside days, but in my opinion it lacks power for FPV applications. And although there are quite some conversions for FPV, I feel like the stock 6mm motors are at their limit if they have to carry the additional weight of even a tiny FPV cam.

So the InductixMaxi was born.

I really do not get why other people didn't do it earlier :). OK, most of those who can fly micro quads do not need propeller protection anymore, but I am still learning... 
Besides, flying (and crashing) a 250 quad can be expensive, and dangerous. This thing is perfect for beginners, well to my opinion it is.
After practice with this thing I feel more confident to fly my 250-sized copter!
