# Summary

This is a Camera/VTX mount for the Blade Inductrix. It fits the ever popular Quanum/HK/Banggood Micro Camera/vtx combo. Weighs in at ~0.85g when printed with TPU, holds the camera securely and eliminates the chance of tearing a SMD component of the board with aggressive double sided tapes.

20 degree mount Works well with the 1.8 lense on these cameras.

All stock hardware is used, super simple installation. Just remove the front, and 2 side Flight Controller Screws, press them into the mount, and reassemble. Slip the cameras power wires through the hole in the mount, and seat the camera in the mount. Solder your power wires to the Battery input pads and your ready to fly.

UPDATE: Added 0 and 10 degree mounts in a lite configuration, also added a Lite 20 degree. Go Whoop it up!
