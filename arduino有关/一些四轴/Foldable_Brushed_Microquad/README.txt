# Summary

This one doesn't make much sense (since when are micros too big?), but it's cute...

83x58mm when folded, 138mm motor-to-motor (diagonally) when unfolded. So no, its not very micro, I know. And it's one heavy micro, don't expect to do any acro with it. I designed it mostly because I had an idea and I like to draw stuff ;)

The Quanum micro camera/vtx combo from HobbyKing fits perfectly and the camera angle is adjustable between 0 and 30 degrees. The arms have slots for clean wiring and to prevent  accidental cutting of motor wires when folding the arms. 

I'm running mine with the following hardware:
 * Beef's Brushed Board (flashed with Betaflight) 
https://www.fpvheadquarters.com/beef-s-brushed-board.html

* 8.5mm (outer diameter) brushed motors

* Parrot Rolling Spider propellers

* Fissel micro frsky rx (only if you have a FrSky compatible transmitter e.g Taranis)
https://www.fpvheadquarters.com/microfrx-receiver.html

* 750 mah 1S Lipo (a bit too big though)

* Micro camera/vtx combo

If you use a Beef's Brushed Board you'll also need an FTDI adapter to communicate with the board

I used the setup above mainly because I already had all the necessary parts at home, there are (most likely) better/cheaper parts out there if you google.

Here's a good page to get you started with hardware similar to the one listed above
https://oscarliang.com/fpv-micro-quad-beef-board/

UPDATE 160709:
Added new arms with slits for the motors (as shown in the pictures). Uploaded the wrong version previously, sorry

UPDATE 160716:
Added new, thicker arms for you guys who prints in PLA. These should hold up better in a crash. Also, user unclecracker made a remix of the arms to fit 7mm motors: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1675767



# Print Settings

Printer: Velleman Vertex K8400
Rafts: No
Supports: No
Resolution: 0.2mm
Infill: 30%

Notes: 
Print the arms upside-down. Print two of each arm. 

I printed mine in PLA which isn't optimal for the application... 

# Post-Printing

"Left arm" goes front left and rear right.
"Right arm" goes front right and rear left.

Mount the camera plate with two M2 screws (min: 4mm, max: 7mm)

Run a nylon or steel screw (M3) through the entire sandwich and secure with a nut.

Here's a pretty crappy clip of it flying with the setup above
